FlyHigh airline would like you to design a real time airline reservation system. The data that need to
be kept in memory (RAM) are as follow. At any point in time the system must be able to handle
150,000 passenger records and the information for 250 flights.
• Passenger name, passport number, DOB, membership status (i.e. gold, silver, non-member)
• Flight number, maximum capacity, departure (location, date and time) and arrival (location,
date and time), list of confirmed passengers, list of passengers under waiting list.
• The allocation of seats under the waiting list will start from members with the gold status.
Non-member has the lowest priority. Within the same status, it will be first come first serve.
The system must be able to perform the following operations.
1. Add a new passenger to a flight.
2. Retrieve the information of all the passengers on a specific flight.
3. Assignment of seat to those under waiting list (pick the next passenger to be assigned a seat)
4. List of flights with the highest occupancy rate
Design a suitable data structure and algorithm to fulfil the 4 operations. The data structure can be
array, linked list, stack or queue. I may require a combination of different types of data structure.
You need to balance the trade-off between space and time. Clearly discuss the space and time
complexity of the data structure and the operations
